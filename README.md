# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A C++ implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** data structure.

A Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree that stores values while maintaining an ordering property:  
for any node, values in the left subtree are less than the node’s value, and values in the right subtree are greater. This property enables efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions on average. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Overview

This project provides a basic BST implemented in C++ from first principles, illustrating:

- BST node structure and pointer management
- Insertion logic maintaining binary search ordering
- Search and traversal operations
- Optional deletion and utility functions

Typical BST operations include:

- **Insert** — add a value to the BST while preserving ordering  
- **Search** — find whether a value exists in the tree  
- **Traversal** — visit nodes in **in-order**, **pre-order**, or **post-order**  
- **Delete** — remove a value while maintaining structure
